# We have two variants of our motd message loaded by login script:
#   1. motd.sh: A dynamic motd that is executed with bash and echos a
#      motd message with escape sequences, optionally with a terminal logo.
#   2. motd: A static motd that is just read as is with cat and displayed.

# The motd-playstore is an additional motd that will only be displayed
# if the termux-app version is very old (like the version found on playstore)
